I had a piece of work published in a math journal. The work deals with approximating infinite factorials by relating them to the natural exponential function when itâ€™s similarly infinite. This is especially useful for handling Taylor series which were top of mind at the time (while taking AP Calc). Looking back on it, the work wasn't that novel and I wouldn't be surprised to find it replicated elsewhere.
