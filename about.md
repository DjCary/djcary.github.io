          <p>I'm Dan Cary: a product manager at Google. I live in the San Francisco Bay area with my wife and dog. I work a bunch, run a bunch, and fiddle a bunch. For work, I'm the PM of Applied Natural Language Understanding Research in Google's Research and Machine Intelligence department.</p>
          <p>I like photography, (video|board) game design, technology, hard sciences, drawing (poorly), and anything competitive. I'm always looking for good book recommendations.</p>
